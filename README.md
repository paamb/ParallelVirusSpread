# ParallelVirusSpread

Parallel Virus Spread simulates the spreading of a disease in a grid filled with infected and healthy people. The infected people can infect a healthy person with an infection rate $\alpha$. The purpose of the project is to experiment with different HPC techniques. These techniques are used to optimize the simulation to improve memory and runtime efficiency.
